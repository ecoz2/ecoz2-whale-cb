# LPC Based Analysis and Clustering on Humpback Whale Vocalizations

The experiments described here mainly follow Juang et al (1982) for the implementation 
of the algorithm for codebook generation as well as in terms of corresponding
evaluation based on distortion performance. 
A summary of key relevant background including LPC analysis and clustering
can be found [here](bg/lpckw.pdf).
In our case, we are exploring this technique for clustering of whale sounds.
The reported experiments are initial steps toward the more general goal
of possibly conforming a basis for development of a whale vocalization 
classification at the sub-unit level 
informed by and including comparison with similar efforts in the community. 

In short, the steps followed in each experiment below are:

- LPC analysis to generate training vectors for clustering from a given
  whale sound file. This generates a single "predictor" file containing
  all the LPC vectors for codebook training.
  
- Codebook generation, inspection, and evaluation.
  This includes plots of distortion, Ïƒ-ratio, and inertia as functions
  of codebook size; cell cardinality and distortion; and visualization of
  the clusters and centroids based on the first couple of
  reflection coefficients associated with the prediction coefficients.

## Setup

To facilitate reproducibility this repository has [ecoz2](https://github.com/ecoz2/ecoz2)
as a submodule (to point to a particular version).

    $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/ecoz2/ecoz2-whale-cb.git
    $ cd ecoz2-whale-cb
    # Build ecoz2 executables:
    $ cd ecoz2/
    $ make
    $ export PATH=`pwd`/_out/bin:$PATH
    $ export PATH=`pwd`/src/py:$PATH
    $ pip install pandas matplotlib 
    $ cd ..
